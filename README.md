# Breast Cancer Prediction

This repository contains a data science project aimed at predicting breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. The project is implemented in Google Colab and utilizes various data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving survival rates. This project uses machine learning to build a predictive model that can assist in the early detection of breast cancer based on various features extracted from breast tissue samples.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Model Building**: Implementing and evaluating different machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Using the best-performing model to make predictions on new data.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

You can view and run the code directly in Google Colab by following this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NkzBY1dcq_HsKUlrrdyBJHjL4MKyznyP#scrollTo=Iif0CVhFDaMp).

## Dataset

The dataset `restaurant-reviews.tsv` contains information that can be used to predict breast cancer diagnosis. It includes various features such as patient 
characteristics and diagnostic measurements. This dataset is used to train machine learning models for predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raj-learns/breast-cancer-prediction.git
    ```
2. Open the `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells step-by-step.
